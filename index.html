        <h2>Havana, 2019</h2>
        <p>I visited Havana with my family in June, 2019 to celebrate my brother’s high school graduation. Pictured here is El Capitolio, which serves as Cuba’s National Capitol Building. The building was commissioned in 1926, by Gerardo Machado, and was completed in 1929. A common misconception is that this building was inspired by the American Capitol Building in Washington, DC, but this is not the case. Architect Eugenio Reynari Piedra says that the building was in fact inspired by the Pantheon, in Greece. </p>

        <h2>Wyoming, 2022</h2>
        <p>I visited Wyoming with a group of friends from work in August of 2022. This picture was taken in Shoshone National Forest, which also stretches into Montana. The mountainous area contains multiple different subsets of the Rocky Mountains, and reaches as high as 13,804 feet. While on this trip, I was also fortunate enough to visit Yellowstone National Park, where the views were even more spectacular.</p>

        <h2>Iceland, 2017</h2>
        <p>During the Summer of 2017, I was fortunate to have the opportunity to visit Iceland on a school trip. This photo was taken at the top of Skógáfoss, a famous waterfall near the southern coast. The water falls just under 200 feet before returning to the Skógá river. The land at the base of the fall is quite flat, and I was able to walk quite close to the falling water, before of course I was drenched.</p>

        <h2>Joshua Tree, 2022</h2>
        <p>Over spring break of my freshman year of college, I flew out to Arizona to visit a longtime friend. From his home in Phoenix, we took a road trip out to Joshua Tree National Park, in Southern California. This photo was taken near the eastern border of the park, just as the sun was setting. As a part of the Mojave Desert, the park offered a wide variety of plant and animal species, as well as unmatched views of the stars once the sun had set. </p>
